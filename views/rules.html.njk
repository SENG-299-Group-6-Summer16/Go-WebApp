			<p>
				To start the size of the board for go can be any odd number between 9x9 and 21x21. To start the game,
				the player with the black tokens goes first, followed by the player with the white tokens. You are
				only allowed to place the tokens on the line intersections on the board. Each adjacent unoccupied spot
				next to a token is a called a liberty. If your tokens have boxed in a area of empty space, that
				space is considered your territory. To capture your opponents tokens you must surround them as to remove
				all of their liberties. For example if the piece is in a corner you only need play tokens on the two open
				sides to capture the token.

			<p>
				To capture multiple adjacent tokens you must remove all the liberties for those tokens. The Ko rule
				states that you can't place a token that would make the board revert to your last turn state.
			</p>

			<p>
				The user is also not allowed to place a token that results in a move that would instantly kill the token.
				Points are calculated by how many tokens own, along with how many tokens you have captured, and all the
				territory that you own. The player with the white tokens also gets a handicap of 6.5 points added to
				their score for	going second. The user with the most points wins the game.
